Concert
=======

This was a group project for Nashville Software School.  The instructor outlined basic requirements of the application, such as allowing the user to click on seats in the map of an auditorium to reserve seats. JL and I had a great time working on this project together--his background in design really shined through.

This project demonstrates:
* test-driven Javascript development
* ability to generate and remove DOM elements based on basic
business logic
* registering and responding to mouse events
